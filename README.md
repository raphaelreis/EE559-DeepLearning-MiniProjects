# Mini projects for the Deep Learning course (EE559)

The goal of these two miniprojects is to learn state of art deep learning libraries handling and how they are built.

# Project 1

The objective of this project is to test different architectures to compare two digits visible in a two-channel  mage. It aims at showing in particular the impact of weight sharing, and of the use of an auxiliary loss to help the training of the main objective.

It is implemented with PyTorch only code, in particular without using other external librariessuch as scikit-learn or numpy

# Project 2

The objective of this project is to design a mini **deep learning framework** using only pytorch'stensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular without using autograd or theneural-network modules.
