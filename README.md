## Project 1 : Comparison of two visible digits in a two channels image
The Goal of this project is to implement different neural network structures to predict if a handwritten digit in the first channel is lesser or equal to the digit in the second channel and 
in particular to test the impact of weight sharing and auxiliary losses.
